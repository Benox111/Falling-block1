Hello Everyone!

This is my first game in Raylib. ðŸŽ®

To run it:

On Windows: Just run the main.exe file.

On Linux (Ubuntu/Mint/Debian): You can use the main file (no extension needed) and make sure you have Raylib installed. You can run it with the following command:

bash
Copier le code
./main
Note: For Linux, ensure you have Raylib installed and compiled with the proper dependencies. You can install Raylib via package managers like apt on Ubuntu:

bash
Copier le code
sudo apt-get install libraylib-dev
Feel free to improve the game and share your feedback!
